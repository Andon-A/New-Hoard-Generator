mincr = Minimum CR for this generator. (Required)
maxcr = Maximum CR for this generator. (Required)
hoarddice = Number and size of dice to use for the GP amount of the hoard. NO modifiers (8d6, not 8d6+3)(Required)
hoardmultiplier = Number to multiply the hoard GP dice by to get the final amount. Must be whole, positive numbers. (Default to 1)
hoarddivisor = Number to divide the hoard GP dice by to get the final amount. Must be whole, positive numbers. (Default to 1)
hoardmodifier = Number added to the hoard GP to get the final amount. Must be whole numbers, but can be negative. Added after multiplication/division(Default to 0)
hoardtries = Number of dice rolls the generator makes for the GP amount. (Default 1)
hoardmaxmin = If the GP takes the highest (MAX) of the tries, or if it takes the lowest (MIN) of the tries. (Default MIN)
treasuredice = As above, but for the value of the treasure pile. (Required)
treasuremultiplier = As above, but for the value of the treasure pile.
treasuredivisor = As above, but for the value of the treasure pile.
treasuremodifier = As above, but for the value of the treasure pile.
treasuretries = As above, but for the value of the treasure pile.
treasuremaxmin = As above, but for the value of the treasure pile.
itemdice = As above, but for the number of magic/special items. (Required)
itemmultiplier = As above, but for the number of magic/special items.
itemmodifier = As above, but for the number of magic/special items.
itemtries = As above, but for the number of magic/special items.
itemmaxmin = As above, but for the number of magic/special items.
commonwt = Weight of getting a common item. Must be non-negative whole number. (Default 1)
uncommonwt = Weight of getting an uncommon item. Must be non-negative whole number. (Default 1)
rarewt = Weight of getting a rare item. Must be non-negative whole number. (Default 1)
veryrarewt = Weight of getting a very rare item. Must be non-negative whole number. (Default 1)
legendarywt = Weight of getting a legendary item. Must be non-negative whole number. (Default 1)
staticwt = Weight of getting a static item. Must be non-negative whole number. (Default 1)
randomwt = Weight of getting a generated item. Must be non-negative whole number. (Default 1)
forcerandomscroll = If TRUE, replaces any static spell scrolls with randomly generated ones, so they have spells attached. If FALSE, static scrolls stay. (Default FALSE)
commonvalue = How much "value" a common item uses (Default 1)
uncommonvalue = How much "value" an uncommon item uses (Default 1)
rarevalue = How much "value" a rare item uses (Default 1)
veryrarevalue = How much "value" a very rare item uses (Default 1)
legendaryvalue = How much "value" a legendary item uses (Default 1)

Notes:
-Individual item chances (IE, Ammunition vs boots vs whatever) is handled inside the generator.
-"Values" are forced to a minimum of 1. Otherwise, you get endless hoards and that makes the program sad.
